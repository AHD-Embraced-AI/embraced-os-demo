# Embraced OS - Demo Documentation

## Overview

**Embraced OS** is a working prototype of the first **AI-native operating system** built on the **Ethically Governed Autonomous Environment (EGAE)** architecture.

This is **not AGI**. Not a model. Not a chatbot.

It's a **deterministic, rule-based operating system core** that uses natural language as the interface — with every action running **fully locally**, **fully explainably**, and **fully under the user's control**.

### What Makes Embraced OS Different

- **14-Layer Architecture**: Complete EGAE stack from L1 (runtime) to L14 (contributions)
- **Ethics-First**: Every action evaluated by L12 Ethics Engine with real-time transparency
- **Local-Only Execution**: Zero cloud dependency, zero API calls, zero surveillance
- **Deterministic**: Same command → same result, every time
- **Explainable**: Full decision logs for every action (policy + ethics + execution)
- **Human-Centered**: Technology that's cooperative, predictable, and safe
